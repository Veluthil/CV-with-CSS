# My CV with CSS

This is a CV (Curriculum Vitae) web page created using HTML and CSS. It provides an organized and structured layout to showcase my background, skills, and experiences.

This project was developed at the beginning of my coding journey as a way to practice HTML and CSS and get familiar with GitHub.
